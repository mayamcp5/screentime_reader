# Screen Time Reader

**Live App:** https://screentimereader.streamlit.app/

__Screen Time Reader__ is a web application that extracts app usage data from iOS and Android screen time screenshots using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

Instead of manually coding screen time data, users can upload screenshots and automatically generate structured, exportable results.

### How It Works
**1. Select Platform Type:** Choose between IOS or Android.

**2. Upload Images:** Upload the set of images for a particular day.

**3. Process and Export:** The platform automatically extracts relevant screen time information, including overall screen time, category/app usage, and hour-by-hour data. Easily compare the data witht the photo itself and copy/export the data you are interested in!

*__Note:__ This process __does not__ guarantee total accuracy. Common errors include artifacts in app names, missing apps, and misread bar charts. Make sure to verify important information before exporting.*
